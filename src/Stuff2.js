        <h2>Why Us?</h2>
          <p>
          Modern computer design has degraded into a series of disappointing and mundane builds.  We look to break the mold with creative and innovative designs that will not only impress but deliver.  Our cases use state of the art base builds that are proven to be reliable, with the bonus of including some of your favorite video characters on top.  This ensures that you not only have a unique computer case, but one that will stand the test of time.  If you have a specific design or character in mind, feel free to reach out to our customer support team to see if you can incorporate it into one of our launch pad builds.  Happy Building!
