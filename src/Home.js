        <p>When looking at the modern landscape of computer case options, it becomes clear that it is a stale environment of mediocracy.  Innovation has been left in the dust, while conformity to trends has been solidified.  Here at Dans Artisanal Cases, we look to break the mold by fusing two passions.  Quality cases to hold our most expensive purchases, and sleek designs that integrate some of our favorite game characters.
